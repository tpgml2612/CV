# About Me
I am a senior undergraduate majoring in <strong>mechanical engineering</strong> at Seoul National University, Korea.
I'm also studying <strong>statistics</strong> as a minor.

I get along well with people participating in the car-making club, coffee club, and photo club, but I also enjoy my time alone, meditating with coffee, or playing games. I'm also continuing yoga to keep healthy.

I want to experience a more expansive world since I was born in Korea and grew up only here except for travel.

<strong><u>My Research Interests</u></strong> are listed below:
* Combination of mechanics, statistical calibration, and optimization
* Mechanical metamaterials
* Additive manufacturing
