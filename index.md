# About Me
I am a senior undergraduate majoring in mechanical engineering at Seoul National University, Korea. I'm also studying statistics as a minor. I get along well with people participating in the car-making club, coffee club, and photo club, but I also enjoy my time alone, meditating with coffee, or playing games. I'm also continuing yoga to keep healthy. Since I was born in Korea and grew up only here except for travel, I want to experience a more expansive world.
