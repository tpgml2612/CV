## Explanation

â€¢ Individual research: Proposed user-independent prior distribution for specific hyperparameter of model discrepancy in Bayesian Calibration
- Conducted numerical experiment to investigate effect of correlation hyperparameter on calibration performance and determine range for numerically stable operation
- Evaluated and compared calibration performance with various prior distributions for verification
- Research paper in progress (Manuscript available)
