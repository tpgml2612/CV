## Individual Research
- I spent time continuing my research and putting the results into writing.

- I worked on my bachelor's thesis on the same subject.

## V&V study
- We (V&V team) reviewed key papers worked by lab alumni.

- Topics were limited to RBDO (Reliability-based design optimization), statistical calibration, and validation.

## Freshmen study
- This program aims to understand the overall concepts of Statistics, Machine learning, and Deep learning, which are essential tools for PHM (Prognostics and Health Management).

- We studied machine learning with the help of seniors, and every time one student explained the content in more detail.

- I presented about Ensemble & Random forest,
