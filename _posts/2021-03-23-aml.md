## Explanation
• Research: Design a device to easily control magnetic field to imbed on 3D printing system for fabrication of magnetic-responsive structure
- Propose systematic process to measure a spatial distribution of strong magnetic field up to 400mT
- Build a device to control the strength and direction of magnetic field
- Currently working with magnetic-responsive materials to show applicability of the device

• Joined journal club and study group
- Shared papers on magnetic-responsive devices and optical & thermal analysis of microstructures
- Studied polymer physics during summer vacation in a group
