## Project for reliability-based battery pack system analysis
* Helped setting up and conducting accelerated life tests of the battery pack system.
* Processed raw data and searched for proper metamodel for pressure curve.

## V&V (Statistical Model Validation & Verification) Study
* Reviewed and discussed selected paper.
* I tried to implement metamodel methods and validation metrics using MATLAB
  * Comparative studies of metamodelling techniques under multiple modeling criteria
  * Quantification of model uncertainty: Calibration, model discrepancy, and identifiability
  * Tutorial on CFD Verification and Validation 
  * Toward a Better Understanding of Model Validation Metrics
  * Bayesian calibration of computer models 
  * A better understanding of model updating strategies in validating engineering models
  * Metamodeling in Multidisciplinary Design Optimization_ How Far Have We Really Come

## Freshmen Seminar: Reliability & Accelerated life test
Materials: Reliability Engineering and Risk Analysis: A Practical Guide (Mohammad Modarres), 가속수명시험(백재욱) 
* I presented two parts:
  * CH.4.1-2 System Reliability Analysis [Reliability Block Diagram Method]
  * 가속수명시험 결합 모형 (Combination models for accelerated life testing)
