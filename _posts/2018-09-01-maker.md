## Explanation
- We designed a light and easy-to-drive ‘box car’ that can run freely on campus.

- It was made of aluminum profiles to create a light and easy-to-assembly car.

- I Participated in the design of the frame using Solidworks, assembly, and performance tests.

- It was able to climb a steep slope. The speed was fast enough to travel quickly inside the campus, and the braking was good. However, I didn't drive well in the video because I didn't have a driver's license yet.
