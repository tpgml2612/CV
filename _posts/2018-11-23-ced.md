## Explanation
- All first-year mechanical students compete by designing robots with a given power source, limited material, and size constraints.

- I played a role in designing robots with Solidworks to meet the standards, reflecting my teammates' ideas.

- I considered manufacturability based on my experience of making products in the club 'Run To You'.

- In the contest, I manipulated a robot using a pneumatic cylinder.
