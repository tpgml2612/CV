## Explanation
- We controlled the wave-stopband of metamaterial plate using shape memory alloy

- We made the plate with Nitinol in a mass-in-mass structure using wire EDM (outsourcing). 

- We used a transducer to generate the wave. We measured the frequency of propagated waves with strain sensors.

- We found that the stopband was changed when heated above the transition temperature.

- I participated in the experiment and mainly took on the role of producing presentation materials.
