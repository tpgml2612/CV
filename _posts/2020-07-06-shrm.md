## Individual research & Regular research meeting
- I started individual research on the prior distribution for correlation hyperparameter of model discrepancy in Bayesian calibration.

- I reviewed some papers dealing with Bayesian calibration and found no rule to select prior distribution of hyperparameters. Therefore, I tried to find a soft option for the prior distribution of correlation hyperparameter.

- We had regular research meetings to share research progress.
